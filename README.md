# Team 15's Automated Judge System


* Accepting a zipped file containing zero or more student submissions as zipped files
* Extracting and processing zero or more Java files in a student submission
* Evaluating all of the required features of the Java classes based on an assignment specification (such as class/method/attribute naming conventions and types, behaviour and functionality of methods, expected abstractions and inheritance hierarchies)
* Producing a PDF file, neatly formatted, that contains a list of all of the tests that the Java classes passed/failed together with helpful corrective feedback for the failed tests. This report file should be added to the same location as the student Java files and should contain the student ID
* Calculating an overall score for the submission using the assignment rubric and printing a breakdown of the marks per test for each class
* A Test suite for evaluation of the systemâ€™s performance
